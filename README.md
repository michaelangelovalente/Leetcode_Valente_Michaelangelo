# LEETCODE Practice
## Data Structures and Algorithms in C, OOP design practice in Java, and SQL practice

### In progress
- [ ] 1. Two sums ( DS used: AVL, HashMap ) 
- [ ] 705. Design Hashset( DS used: AVL) 
- [ ] 797. All paths from source to target ( )
- [ ] 909. Snakes and ladders &#129144;
- [ ] 1059. All paths from source lead to destination
- [ ] 1168. Optimize water distribution in a village
- [ ] 1631. Path with minimum effort ( Algo used: modified version of Dijkstra. DS used: Priority queue implemented with a Min-heap )  
- [ ] 1202. smallest string with swaps &#129144;

### Done
- [x] 110. Balanced Binary Tree ( DS used: AVL )
- [x] 136. Single Number ( used XOR boolean l. ) 
- [x] 198. House Robber ( Dynamic Programming approach used: Bottom-up and Top-down)
- [x] 202. Happy number ( DS used: BST, HashSet /w nodes ) 
- [x] 349. Intersection of two arrays ( DS used: BST, HashSet /w nodes ) 
- [x] 706. Design Hash Map ( DS used: linked list *to handle collisions* ) 
- [x] 740. Delete and Earn (Dynamic Programming paradigm. Bottom-up approach ) 
- [x] 743. Network Delay Time ( Algo used to solve the problem: There are two versions, Dijkstra that uses a Priorityqueue )
